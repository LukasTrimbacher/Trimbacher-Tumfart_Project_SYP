\section{Introduction}
Your FinanceM application should be a helping hand to have an overview about your finances. The user can document his expenditure, bills, income and his money flow. 
The application is going to have an userfriendly interface which makes it more easier to work with it even if you are not into technologie.
After all it should be an application which is easy to handle that helps the user to have a better overview about his in and outgoings.
\pagebreak

\section{Initial Situation}

You are a busy person which is not this much into technologie?
Thats is no problem, with the FinanceM application our team is working on the target to make it as easy as possible to creat an overview for the user about his in and outgoings and creating an finance plan for you.

\pagebreak

\section{General Conditions and Constraints}

To run our application smoothly and without technical incidents we recommand:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The language is english
	\item An easy usable userinterface
	\item Saving userdata on the device and not at an server for more security
	\item Use of PSD2 to synchronise the application with your bank account
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\section{Project Objectives and System Concepts}

The objectives of our project are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Its easy for the user to enter the informations in a structured way
\item Compared overview for the user
\item In and outgoings are collected into groups(food, mobility, etc. )
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\section{Opportunities and Risks}

Our application has the following opportunities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Making it easier for the users to have a overview about their finances
\item Its takes less time than with a pen and paper
\end{itemize}
There are also a few risks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Its hard to get the live data from the bankaccounts
	\item Storing the data at the local device
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\section{Planning}
List of project milestones

\begin{itemize}	
	\item a rough user interface with some functionalities
	\item simple user login with an server where we save the user data
	\item become access to bank account to get incomes and outcomes
	\item secure user data on the server
	\item make the userinterface cleaner and add more functions to it
\end{itemize}

Project Leaders and an overview of how much resources we need
\\

Project Leaders: Lukas Trimabcher and Christoph Tumfart
\\

Resources we need:
\\

We need 2 people to do the coding and maybe someone to help us with the graphical part of the user interface. Apart from that we need a license so we can get access to the bank accounts of the users.
And of course another server on which we save the user data.
\\

So the project will start on the November 12th this is where we start to implement the userinterface. That would take his time but we think it should be an prototype available after 3-4 weeks.
After we finished the userinterface prototype with and simple user login we have a big chunk to deal with: become access to the bank account to get the incomes and outcomes, the coding is not the big problem in this case, its further the licens from the bank.
\\

When we managed to get a license from the bank and finished the coding, the biggest one is actually done, we just have to make an simple server client communication and need to secure the data wich could be another problem but i think we can manage it.
\\

I think that the biggest problem is the TIME we should get the prototype of the user interface well in time done, but accessing the bank account will be difficult because we do not yet know how and how long it takes to get a license.
